I am currently a 3rd year student pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at IIT Delhi. A deep-seated passion for Machine Learning and Deep Learning fuels my academic journey. 

Beyond the practical aspects, I am drawn to the mathematical foundations that underpin computer science, finding beauty and inspiration in the elegant logic and structures that form the backbone of our digital world.

As an enthusiastic learner, I am not just interested in keeping up with the latest advancements but actively engaging with them. I thrive on challenges and view each one as an opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills.
